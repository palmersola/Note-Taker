# Note-Taker-Application

## Project

Created a note taking application using starter code. It takes the user's note title and text and saves them to be read at a future time. This application uses Express and Node.JS to execute the server-side functions.

## Heroku

Since we are new to Heroku, for some reason it is slow and takes a few seconds for changes to occur. When run through my own terminal it is insant, so I'm not sure what it is happening with that.
